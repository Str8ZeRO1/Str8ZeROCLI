This file serves as a placeholder for Alex Trujillo's signature.

The actual signature image is not stored in the public repository for security reasons.
Instead, it is securely stored in the user's local Str8ZeROCLI installation using encryption.

When legal documents are generated or displayed, the signature is retrieved from secure storage
and applied to the documents as needed.
